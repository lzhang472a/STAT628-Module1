Because linear model is overall the simplest statistical model with the best interpretability. What's more, we will make the assumption that the random effect in the model has a normal distribution. Because BFP may be effected by many underlying aspects. Some of them will have positive effects, some will have negative effects. So Normal distribution can describe the add-up effect of these aspects best from its property."

From the box-plot we can observe that with different age ranges, variables like BODYFAT, HEIGHT, WEIGHT are basically of the same pattern. So we can believe that age does not have special effect.\n",

This means that when using this model, approximately the 80% of people will have their results within a [-5,+5] interval of the true value.<br>\n",
